### 🧠 About Me

I’m a backend-focused Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience designing and implementing **high-performance systems** in the fintech and infrastructure space. My core expertise lies in the **Rust programming language**, particularly with frameworks like **Actix Web** and **SQLx**.

I specialize in:
- ✳️ Scalable microservices architecture (Rust, TypeScript)
- 🧮 SQL performance tuning and zero-downtime migrations
- 🧭 Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture
- 🔐 Security, observability, and resilient design patterns

I currently work as a **Senior Software Engineer at Aella MFB**, where I lead system design, performance optimization, and engineering best practices for business-critical services.
